**About:** 
<p align="justify">

I am Yasmin Fathy, a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Engineering. I have strong leadership, communication and management skills to achieve organizational goals and collaborate effectively with others. I have experience in effectively controlling and mitigating project risks while creating rapport and building long-term successful relationships with stakeholders. <br> <br>


I have various professional experiences in successfully developing data analytics and ML solutions that explain their automated and predictive decisions while tackling complex business problems and adhering to regulatory requirements. <br> <br>

I am passionate about solving challenging problems with real-world implications. I am always keen to develop new technologies and solutions to extract insights from data, test hypotheses, and build ML models to address complex queries and questions. <br> <br>

I am an active advocate for diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace, a passion shaped by my inquisitive personality and eureka moments in my professional and personal lives. As a Race at Work Mentor within the Reverse Mentoring Program at Barclays, I am offering a safe space for top managers/leaders to learn and be exposed to challenging dialogue while learning about the lived experiences of Black and Minority colleagues. <br> <br>

I am always keen to participate in collective positive action to identify and remove barriers and biases that prevent marginalized groups from having equal opportunities at work.<br> <br>

  <summary><b>Extended Bio</b></summary><br>
<p align="justify">
Iâ€™m Yasmin Fathy, a Data Scientist at Barclays Bank UK PLC and a UK Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. I mainly work on designing & developing data analytics and ML solutions that explain their automated-predictive decisions while tackling complex business problems and adhering to regulatory requirements. <br> <br>

Before joining Barclays, I was a Research Associate at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge. Prior to that, I was a Software Developer at Genomics Analytics Group at European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Research Associate in IoT and Machine Learning at Cambridge University, and a KTP Research Associate in Data Science and Machine Learning at UCL. I obtained my PhD from the <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/institute-communication-systems">Institute for Communication Systems (ICS)</a> at the University of Surrey and an MSc in Applied Science and Engineering from the <a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/">Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab</a> at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) in Belgium.<br> <br>

I was an active reviewer and a technical program committee member for multidisciplinary and international journals and conferences, including CCNC, The Web Conference (WWW), IEEE Systems, IEEE IoT Journal, IEEE Transactions on Big Data, and IEEE Access. I was a Topic Editorial in Frontiers in Big Data: Women in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Initiative, a Data Champion at the University of Cambridge and a member of the Cambridge Centre for Data-Driven Discovery (C2D3). I was a BSF (Become a Science Founder) Fellow for entrepreneurship scientists in 2021 and was awarded MEDASTAR Erasmus Mundus and University of Surrey scholarships. <br> <br>

Having a genuine interest in helping others achieve their personal/professional development objectives, I am mentoring graduates and junior engineers. I mainly guide and coach them by setting development goals, sharing experiences, and helping them overcome challenges and achieve their career goals. I am also a race mentor within a reverse mentoring program at Barclays, where I offer a safe space for top leaders to learn and be exposed to challenging dialogue while learning about the lived experiences of Black and Minority colleagues. Previously, I was a volunteer mentor for supporting students with soft & English skills development at <a href="https://manara.tech/">Manara</a> and a volunteer instructor at <a href="https://codefirstgirls.com/">Code First Girls (CFGs)</a>.
